Muito prazer!

Nice to meet you! I'm a software developer, originally from Brazil, SÃ£o Paulo. I love writing code for android and web based platforms and games as well, my main objective today is to work as a developer. I've did a lot of projects on the current enterprise I work on, here on my GitHub you can sneak peak some of these projects.

In my free time, I've been working on a [metroidvania engine on top of Unity3D](https://github.com/maiksonstrife/FoxTale) as a on-going study project. 
Besides that, I love playing video games (Splatoon 2, nintendo in general, a lot of passion by oldschool games).
